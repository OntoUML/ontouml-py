# ontouml-py

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OntoUML/ontouml-py/main/ontouml-py/resources/logo-ontouml-py.png" width="740"></p>

Python software that implement validation rules for OntoUML models represented as OntoUML Vocabulary graphs

**ðŸ“¦ PyPI Package:**
The transformation is conveniently [available as a PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/ontouml-py/), which
allows users to use it as an executable script or import it as a library into other Python projects.

**ðŸ“š Documentation:**
For inquiries and further information, please refer to
the [comprehensive docstring-generated documentation](https://w3id.org/ontouml/ontouml-py/docs) available for this
project.

## Installation

Before using the OntoUML Graph ontouml-py, you need to [download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the application you simply need to perform the following command:

```text
pip install ontouml-py
```

All dependencies will be installed automatically, and you will be ready to use the ontouml-py package.

## Introduction

Corresponds to the OntoUML-JS, but for manipulation of RDF graphs.
Enhances RDFLib's functionalities. Treats specific necessities of OntoUML.
Works with the OntoUML vocabulary. Complies with its version 1.1.0.
Under development. Currently, provides limited functionality.


## Concepts

### OUTerm

Refers to a term in the OntoUML Vocabulary. 

Provides usability just like RDFLib does to OWL, RDF, etc. I.e., it can be used like this: 
Examples:
```python
x = OntoUML.Class
ic(x) # result  
```


- Accesses: No other concepts.
- Accessed By: Directly, OUEnumeration, OUGraph, and OUElement.


### RDF Graph

An RDFLib Graph is in this context called simply rdf graph.

- Accesses: No other concepts.
- Accessed By: Directly, OUGraph, OUElement.

### OUGraph

It is intended to be used to aggregate OUElements.
Do not need to be composed of OUElements to exist.
Relates to RDFLib Graphs by load_graph and update_graph methods. 
- Accesses: OUEnumeration, OUTerm, OUElement, Graph. 
- Accessed By: Directly only.

### OUElement

OUElements are classes directly representing OntoUML Vocabulary's classes.
Do not need to be inside an OUGraph to exist.

Have access to OUTerms and Graphs.
- Accesses: OUTerms and Graphs.
- Accessed By: Directly, OUGraphs.

### OUEnumerations

Have access to OUTerms. 
- Accesses: OUTerms.
- Accessed By: Directly, OUGraphs.
