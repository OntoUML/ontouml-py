## The OntoUML-JS

[OntoUML JS](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-js) is a versatile JavaScript library tailored for effortlessly handling OntoUML models. It streamlines the process of manipulating OntoUML models and serializing them into [`ontouml-schema`](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-schema) compliant JSON files. With OntoUML JS, developers can efficiently create and manage OntoUML elements, construct models, and perform various model-related tasks programmatically. This library introduces constructor methods for creating OntoUML elements, provides support for container elements like projects and packages, and facilitates element serialization and deserialization. Additionally, OntoUML JS is continually updated with useful methods to simplify the development of OntoUML models. Whether you are working on ontology-driven conceptual modeling or require a tool for handling complex domain ontologies, OntoUML JS offers a valuable utility to streamline your workflow.
