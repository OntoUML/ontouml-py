"""This subpackage contains various enumeration classes used in the OntoUML framework.

Each enumeration class represents a specific set of constants that are relevant to the OntoUML domain.
These enumerations are designed to provide structured, predefined values for different OntoUML elements and attributes.

Each enumeration class in this subpackage extends from `OntoumlEnum`, which provides common functionality for OntoUML
enumerations, including automatic conversion of enum member names to CamelCase format and a method to retrieve
all enum members.

This subpackage is integral to ensuring that the OntoUML framework utilizes consistent and well-defined sets of
values across its various components.
