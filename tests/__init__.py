"""Tests Package for OntoUML Python Project.

This subpackage contains a comprehensive suite of tests designed to ensure the robustness and correctness of the \
OntoUML Python Project.
It includes unit tests, integration tests, and other test utilities that collectively validate the functionality \
of the project's components, including classes, methods, and integration points.

Each test module within this subpackage is dedicated to a specific aspect of the project, ensuring thorough coverage \
and validation of the project's features and behaviors. The tests are crafted to be as informative and communicative \
as possible, adhering to best practices in software testing.

Features
--------
- Comprehensive testing: Each class and method in the project is accompanied by a set of tests to validate its \
expected behavior.
- Informative assertions: Tests are designed with clear and informative assertion messages to aid in debugging \
and understanding test failures.
- Type hints and docstrings: Tests are annotated with type hints and detailed docstrings in Sphinx format, \
providing clarity on test purposes and methodologies.
- Fixture reuse: Wherever possible, fixtures are reused across tests to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.
- Error handling validation: Tests include scenarios to validate proper error handling and edge cases.

Usage
-----
To run the tests, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the test suite using a test runner like pytest.

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest tests/

This will run all tests in the `tests` subpackage and report the results.

.. note::
    The tests are designed to be run in an isolated environment to avoid interference with production data or \
    configurations.

.. warning::
    Ensure all dependencies are installed and the Python environment is correctly set up before running the tests.

Contributing
------------
Contributions to the test suite are welcome. When adding new tests or modifying existing ones, ensure they adhere to the
project's testing standards and guidelines.
