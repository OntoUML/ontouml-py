:py:mod:`ontouml_py.classes.concrete_classes.literal`
=====================================================

.. py:module:: ontouml_py.classes.concrete_classes.literal

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module is part of the ontouml_py class and defines the Literal class, a specialized type of ModelElement. The Literal class represents literals in an ontological model, particularly for enumeration classes.

   Literals traditionally exist as relational dependents of their classes, particularly in the context of
   enumerations. However, to facilitate more versatile object manipulation, the library supports the creation of 'free'
   literals, independent of any class. This feature allows users to define literals without the immediate need to
   associate them with a specific class, providing a flexible workflow. These free literals can later be integrated into
   classes as required, enhancing the dynamic interaction between literals and their associated classes.

   Represent a literal in an ontological model, extending the ModelElement class.

   This class is designed to represent literals, which are specific values or identifiers in an enumeration.
