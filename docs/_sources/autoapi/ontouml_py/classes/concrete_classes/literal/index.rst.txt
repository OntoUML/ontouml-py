=====================================================

.. py:module:: ontouml_py.classes.concrete_classes.literal

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module is part of the ontouml_py package and defines the Literal class, a specialized type of ModelElement.

   The Literal class represents literals in an ontological model, particularly for enumeration classes. It ensures that
   literals are created and managed in a controlled manner, adhering to the constraints and structure of the ontological
   model.

   Bases: :py:obj:`ontouml_py.classes.abstract_classes.modelelement.ModelElement`

   Represent a literal in an ontological model, extending the ModelElement class.

   This class is designed to represent literals, which are specific values or identifiers in an enumeration.
   It overrides the default constructor to prevent direct instantiation and provides a factory method for
   controlled creation of literal instances.

   .. py:method:: _create_instance(**data)
      :classmethod:

      Factory method to create a new instance of Literal.

      Creates a new instance of Literal, bypassing the overridden constructor. This method allows for the
      controlled instantiation of literals, ensuring they are created in accordance with the model's constraints.

      :param data: A dictionary containing the data needed to initialize the Literal.
      :type data: dict
      :return: A new instance of Literal.
      :rtype: Literal
