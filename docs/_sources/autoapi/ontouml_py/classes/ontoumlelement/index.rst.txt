   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   An abstract base class that represents a generic element within an OntoUML model.

   This class provides a common interface for OntoUML elements, including unique identifier generation and timestamp
   management for creation and modification times. It is not meant to be instantiated directly but rather extended
   by more specific element types.

   :ivar _id: A unique identifier for the element, intended to be read-only.
   :vartype _id: uuid.UUID
   :ivar created: A timestamp marking when the element was created.
   :vartype created: datetime
   :ivar modified: An optional timestamp marking when the element was last modified.
   :vartype modified: datetime, optional
