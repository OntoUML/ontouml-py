===================================

.. py:module:: ontouml_py.model.relation

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provide the `Relation` class, a subclass of `Classifier`, representing relations in an ontological model. It supports various relation stereotypes as defined in the `RelationStereotype` enumeration.

   The `Relation` class is an abstract base class and is intended to be subclassed by specific types of relations,
   such as `BinaryRelation` and `NaryRelation`. It includes validation for these subclasses and allows for the
   configuration of Pydantic model settings.

   Bases: :py:obj:`ontouml_py.model.classifier.Classifier`

   Abstract base class representing a generic element within an OntoUML model.

   This class provides foundational attributes and methods for all OntoUML elements, including unique identification
   and timestamps for creation and modification. It enforces constraints on certain attributes and includes validation
   logic to maintain their integrity.

   :ivar id: A unique identifier for the element, automatically generated upon instantiation.
   :vartype id: str
   :ivar created: Timestamp when the element was created, defaults to the current time.
   :vartype created: datetime
   :ivar modified: Timestamp when the element was last modified, can be None if not modified.
   :vartype modified: Optional[datetime]
   :cvar model_config: Configuration settings for the Pydantic model.
   :vartype model_config: Dict[str, Any]
