:py:mod:`ontouml-py.classes._ouelement`
=======================================

.. py:module:: ontouml-py.classes._ouelement

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module provides the foundational class for representing elements in OntoUML models.
   It includes the `_OUElement` class, which serves as the main class for OntoUML models, and
   is designed to be private to prevent direct instantiation. The module also includes
   necessary exceptions for handling issues related to OntoUML ID and type mismatches.

   The `_OUElement` class is initialized with a URI reference representing the object's ID,
   and performs checks to ensure that the ID exists in the provided OntoUML graph and has a
   valid type. It raises exceptions (`OUIDNotInGraph`, `OUIDTypeMismatchError`) when these
   checks fail, providing informative error messages to facilitate debugging.
